## Overview
This project involves the development of a website for the fictional Sunnyside Agency, focusing on modern web development techniques and responsive design. 

## What I Learned

- **JavaScript Interactivity**: Improved mobile navigation functionality using JavaScript, handling menu visibility and user interactions.
- **Semantic HTML**: Applied semantic HTML elements to structure the website content logically and accessibly.

## Tools and Techniques
- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the website content.
- **CSS3**: Employed for styling, including flexbox for layout management, media queries for responsiveness, and pseudo-elements for advanced styling.
- **JavaScript**: Added interactivity to the website, particularly for the mobile navigation toggle.
- **Version Control (Git)**: Managed and documented changes to the project.

## Future Enhancements
- Further optimization for different devices.
- Additional interactive elements and animations.
